Hello Omar, 

To refactor the chat client, I chose the STATE pattern. 

The reason why I chose it is because the behavior depends on an internal 'mode' variable, as described in the homework instructions. Because it is an internal change of state, rather than a choice by the user, STATE would be the better choice for this task. 

Please see below for my PUML diagram.
